This article is about how to create this site.
"Strike while the iron is hot" so I would like to write this article before I forget.

The technology stack is as follows:

- Bun(1.0.2)
  - "Sekaiteki desu monne! Norushikanai, kono big wave ni!"
- Astro(3.1.0)
  - Astro is more popular than Docusaurus. (as far as I know)
- GitHub Pages
  - Free.
- TypeScript(5.2.2)
  - I like statically typed languages.
- VSCodes
  - The usual editor.

The sample repository prepared for this article is [here](https://github.com/michiharu/deploy-astro-to-github-pages).

## Prepare the environment

The explanation assumes that VSCode is already installed.

### Install Bun

Since I am a macOS user, I installed bun using the command on [the official page](https://bun.sh/).

```zsh
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
bun -v
1.0.2
```

### Create an astro project with Bun

There are articles on the Bun side and Astro side.

- [Bun: Build an app with Astro and Bun](https://bun.sh/guides/ecosystem/astro)
- [Astro: Use Bun with Astro](https://docs.astro.build/ja/recipes/bun/)

I executed the following command referring to the article on the Bun side.

```bash
bun create astro
```

You will be asked a number of questions, but the two most important in this article are:

- tmpl: How would you like to start your new project?
  - Use blog template
- ts: Do you plan to write TypeScript?
  - Yes

## Deployment settings to Github Pages

Open VSCode and start the local environment([http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321)).

```bash
bun run dev
```

<Image name="bun-run-dev_1742_1446.png" />

The following two points are important when setting up deployment to Github Pages.

- The subdirectory name is the repository name.
- GitHub Pages link must have a trailing slash (`/`) at the end.
  - If the trailing slash (`/`) is missing, it will be redirected.

### Configure `astro.config.mjs`

Official documentation is [here](https://docs.astro.build/ja/guides/deploy/github/)

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import mdx from '@astrojs/mdx';

import sitemap from '@astrojs/sitemap';

// https://astro.build/config
export default defineConfig({
  site: 'https://michiharu.github.io',
  base: '/deploy-astro-to-github-pages',
  trailingSlash: 'always',
  integrations: [mdx(), sitemap()],
});
```

`michiharu` is my GitHub user ID and `deploy-astro-to-github-pages` is the repository name.
Please read as appropriate to suit your own environment.

Although it is not described in the official documentation, settings for trailing slash have been added.
It will work as is, but different behavior between the development environment and the production environment will cause bugs.
So set `trailingSlash: 'always'` according to your production environment.
By setting this, you can prevent accidents such as "It was displayed locally but 404 when deployed".

### Modify each link

When you edit the above `astro.config.mjs`, [http://localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321) becomes 404 as shown below.

<Image name="404-not-found_2142_1418.png" />

If you click `/deploy-astro-to-github-pages/` displayed on this 404 page, the Home page will be displayed again.

<Image name="subdirectory-home_2142_1418.png" />

However, when I click on the blog, about, etc. links in the header, I get a 404 error.
This is because each link in the astro template does not contain subdirectories.

Therefore, it is necessary to modify all links to include subdirectories.
It seems like everyone is trying various things to deal with this issue, but there doesn't seem to be a best practice method so far.

I steadily modified the URL to include the subdirectory.
`base` in `astro.config.mjs` is the repository name and subdirectory.
This `base` value can be referenced from `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`, so I shared the reference of `import.meta.env.BASE_URL` with the `url` function as follows.
By using the `url` function, the JS side can include all subdirectories in the URL.

````typescript
/**
 * ```typescript
 * url('/')          => '/subdirectory/'
 * url('/blog/')     => '/subdirectory/blog/'
 * url('/image_200_100.png') => '/subdirectory/image_200_100.png'
 * ```
 */
export const url = (path: string | undefined) => {
  if (path === undefined) return undefined;
  const base = import.meta.env.BASE_URL.replace(/\/$/, '');
  return `${base}${path}`;
};
````

Please check [this commit](https://github.com/michiharu/deploy-astro-to-github-pages/commit/fedc5e4acd312c98080b0b7f0f0b9af2d5c0543b).

I open the browser console and try the following four types of page transitions to check for any defects or errors.

- `/subdirectory/`
- `/subdirectory/blog/`
- `/subdirectory/blog/markdown-style-guide/`
- `/subdirectory/about/`

`src/components/Header.astro`

```diff
-   <h2><a href="/">{SITE_TITLE}</a></h2>
+   <h2><a href={url('/')}>{SITE_TITLE}</a></h2>
    <div class="internal-links">
-     <HeaderLink href="/">Home</HeaderLink>
-     <HeaderLink href="/blog">Blog</HeaderLink>
-     <HeaderLink href="/about">About</HeaderLink>
+     <HeaderLink href={url('/')}>Home</HeaderLink>
+     <HeaderLink href={url('/blog/')}>Blog</HeaderLink>
+     <HeaderLink href={url('/about/')}>About</HeaderLink>
    </div>
```

`BlogPost.astro`

```diff
...
import { url } from '../funcs';
...
- const { title, description, pubDate, updatedDate, heroImage } = Astro.props;
+ const { title, description, pubDate, updatedDate } = Astro.props;
+ const heroImage = url(Astro.props.heroImage);
...
```

Next, what you tend to forget unless you check the browser console is the font link written in CSS.
Below is an example of modifying `global.css`.

```diff
...
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Atkinson';
- src: new URL('/fonts/atkinson-regular.woff') format('woff');
+ src: new URL('/my-way/fonts/atkinson-regular.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: 400;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Atkinson';
- src: new URL('/fonts/atkinson-bold.woff') format('woff');
+ src: new URL('/my-way/fonts/atkinson-bold.woff') format('woff');
  font-weight: 700;
  font-style: normal;
  font-display: swap;
}
...
```

Since the `url` function cannot be used for CSS, I include the repository name that I plan to deploy directly.

### Configuring GitHub Actions

On your GitHub page, select `GitHub Actions` under Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source.

<Image name="github-pages-setting_2142_1418.png" />

Next, copy the [official documentation](https://docs.astro.build/ja/guides/deploy/github/) and save as `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

```yml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages

on:
  # Trigger the workflow every time you push to the `main` branch
  # Using a different branch name? Replace `main` with your branchâ€™s name
  push:
    branches: [main]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab on GitHub.
  workflow_dispatch:

# Allow this job to clone the repo and create a page deployment
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout your repository using git
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install, build, and upload your site
        uses: withastro/action@v0
        # with:
        # path: . # The root location of your Astro project inside the repository. (optional)
        # node-version: 20 # The specific version of Node that should be used to build your site. Defaults to 16. (optional)
        # package-manager: yarn # The Node package manager that should be used to install dependencies and build your site. Automatically detected based on your lockfile. (optional)

  deploy:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment:
      name: github-pages
      url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
        id: deployment
        uses: actions/deploy-pages@v1
```

Even if you do not use the commented out `with:` option,
`bun install` will be executed and deployed to GitHub Pages.

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ Thank you for your hard work.
