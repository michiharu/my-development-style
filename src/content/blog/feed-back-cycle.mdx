It feels good to be able to proceed with development smoothly.
The feedback cycle is the key to smooth development.

By the way, what is feedback?

In this article, feedback is defined as information that allows you to check the correctness of your code.
The series of processes for checking feedback is called a feedback cycle.

The book "Beyond Legacy Code" states:

> Small batches are desirable from a feedback cycle perspective.
> This applies to almost all feedback cycles in software development.
>
> <Cite href={legacyCodeUrl} text="Beyond Legacy Code" />

The ideal environment is one where you can check feedback in real time while writing code.
In such an environment, even if you are writing incorrect code, you can quickly notice and correct it.
A smaller feedback cycle contributes to a smoother development experience.

The build time is greatly related to the realization of such an environment.
I'll quote again from "Beyond Legacy Code":

> Create a build environment that returns results within 3 seconds instead of 3 hours.

## Feedback cycle in development

With the theme of web UI development, let's consider the impact of the feedback cycle on development.
UI development involves repeating the process of changing code and checking it in the browser.
The breakdown of the cycle is as follows:

- Change and save code
- Wait for changes to appear in browser
- Confirm the changes displayed in your browser

Change + Wait + Confirm is one cycle.
Calculate the number of cycles per hour in an environment where the waiting time is 1 second and 60 seconds.

All conditions are:

| Action                                        | Seconds per cycle |
| :-------------------------------------------- | ----------------: |
| Change and save code                          |            60 sec |
| Wait for changes to appear in browser         |   1 sec or 60 sec |
| Confirm the changes displayed in your browser |            10 sec |

Calculating the number of cycles per hour is:

| Waiting time (sec) | Number of cycles per hour           |
| -----------------: | :---------------------------------- |
|              1 sec | 3600 Ã· (60 + 1 + 10) = 50.7 cycles  |
|             60 sec | 3600 Ã· (60 + 60 + 10) = 27.7 cycles |

In an environment where 60 seconds of waiting is required, almost half of the work time is waiting time.
That's why build time is so important.

Larger batches may reduce waiting time,
but this may result in unnecessary costs and risks.

The relationship between the scope of changes and work time is not a linear function.
I don't know what kind of function it will be, but it should be a curve like an exponential function or a factorial.

The more scope of change you make, the more time you will spend on it.

## Various feedbacks

As one of the feedback, I gave an example of checking in the browser,
Other feedback includes:

- Feedback from editor
  - Syntax highlighting
  - Type check result
  - Lint checking and auto-correction
- Unit test execution results
- Feedback via interactive execution environment (e.g. Jupyter Notebook)
- Logs

Let's create an environment where these things are automatically feedback.
By utilizing such feedback, you can write correct code with fewer attempts.

## Let's buy time with money

The pursuit of speed never ends.

- Webpack => Vite or Turbopack
- Nodejs => Deno => Bun

When I first tried Vite, I was impressed by how fast it was.
Thank you to everyone who develops wonderful languages and tools.

Although it is important to adopt fast techniques and reduce feedback cycles in the development environment,
There is a faster, simpler way to speed things up.

Use a proper machine. Spend at least $1,200.

Here I will introduce two of the worst development experiences I had on low-spec machines.

### 15 minute build time

My first job as an engineer was around 2012, when I was still a university student.
My work is developing Android apps.
I started with a laptop with 1GB of memory that I bought when I entered university.
First, I started an Android emulator and created an environment to check its operation.
And I found out that it takes about 15 to 20 minutes after clicking the â–· button in Eclipse.

I thought this was bad, so within a few days I bought a new laptop with 8GB of memory.
Furthermore, I debugged on the actual device instead of the emulator.
Then, you can check the operation on the actual device in about 10 seconds by clicking the â–· button.
I was lucky that I was able to work on my own computer, so the problem was quickly resolved.

### 3 minutes to display TypeScript code completion

The story is that even 8GB of memory will not be enough for development after 2022.

In 2022, with technologies such as VSCode, TypeScript, Vite, Vue3, Volar (VSCode extension of Vue3),
A new project has started.

However, when I set up the development environment, the editor was very heavy.
I was using a company-issued HP laptop with 8GB of memory.
Looking at the memory usage status, 8GB was used up and memory â‡„ SSD swapping occurred.

It takes more than 3 minutes to display TypeScript errors and code completion on VSCode.
It was a hellish development environment, with ESLint + Prettier processing taking over 3 minutes before saving the file.

I think I was in a situation where I was waiting for the PC to process for more than 4 hours a day.
If your work isn't progressing, it means your skills aren't improving either.
I was constantly working with the feeling that I was wasting time, and it was really exhausting.

After that, I also experienced the development of Nextjs on the same machine from 2023,
TypeScript errors and code completion were displayed in 2-10 seconds, and ESLint + Prettier processing before saving the file took 2-3 seconds.
When I compared my development experience with Nextjs, I realized that the compatibility between Vue3 and TypeScript was quite poor.
That said, I think TypeScript code completion would have been displayed within 3 seconds if the machine specs were sufficient.

Even with the 2017 model MacBook Pro (16GB of memory) that I use for personal development,
TypeScript errors and code completion are displayed instantly, and ESLint + Prettier before saving the file is also instantaneous.

It was an experience that made me understand just how much machine specs affect development speed.

## Conclusion

The feedback cycle is the key to smooth development.
If you invest in reducing feedback cycles,
In many cases, you will be able to recover your investment.

The approximate build time for web development is as follows:

| Frontend                       | Backend                                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Screen display within 1 second | Display unit test results within 3 seconds |

If you are using a machine with 8GB of memory, buy or have someone buy one with 16GB or more ðŸ’¸.
