<AboutLayout>
  <p>Hi, I'm Michiharu Fukagawa. I'm a Japanese web engineer.</p>
  <p>
    I grew up in Saitama Prefecture until I was 12 years old, and from junior
    high school to high school in Oita Prefecture. I entered the Business
    Administration at Yokohama National University. Then I started Tcial Co.,
    Ltd. Tcial's business was the operation of a small private school. The
    number of students was around 30 to 40. After running Tcial for 4 years, I
    became a freelance engineer. Since then, I have spent the past seven years
    pursuing a career focused on engineering.
  </p>
  <p>I like making things. I likes agile development.</p>
